        <p>Hi, my name is Gavin. I love going to the gym, learning new things, and staying active. I'm from Las Vegas and I have lived here in Utah for almost a year. I spent two years serving a mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints in Brazil. I am the oldest of four kids and have been like a guinea pig my entire life. I went to four different high schools and ran track for my zoned public school. In track I did pole vault and ran the 100 meter and 200 meter races. I am currently majoring in software development with the goal to become a full-stack developer for a large tech company. I'm hoping to gain enough experience from that job to break off and start my own software company. I want to have a family with six kids, two being adopted from Haiti.</p>
